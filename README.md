# Swiggy_home_page
This is the initial version of a mock home page of Swiggy that I designed using HTML and CSS. Please note that this project is incomplete as its purpose was primarily to gain a basic understanding of CSS. As a beginner, I focused on grasping the fundamentals of CSS and did not prioritize making it responsive.

I am uploading this project as a way to learn version control systems (Git & GitHub). It was after completing this project that I learned about version control, so there is only one commit made prior to uploading it to GitHub.

Please keep in mind that this is a learning project and may not reflect a fully functional or polished implementation.
